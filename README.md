## 🎯 Project Overview

This is an Android application prototype under active development, designed to enable **offline peer-to-peer messaging** between devices using **Wi-Fi Direct and persistent socket connections**.  
The goal is to build a robust solution for emergency or low-connectivity situations where mobile networks or the internet are unavailable.

---

## 🚀 Current Features (Early Prototype)

✅ Device connection using **Wi-Fi Direct**  
✅ Basic peer-to-peer **message sending and receiving**  
✅ Simple UI built with **Jetpack Compose**

⚠️ The project is still in early development.  
The following features are actively being implemented:
- Mesh relay system for multi-hop message forwarding  
- Persistent offline message storage with Room Database  
- Error handling and stable connection management  
- Performance optimization and clean architecture improvements

## 🔧 Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Kotlin | App development |
| Jetpack Compose | UI framework |
| Wi-Fi Direct | Peer-to-peer connection |
| Room Database | Local message storage |
| Retrofit | Future network scalability |
| Android Studio | IDE |

---

## 📚 How It Works (So Far)

1. Two Android devices connect using **Wi-Fi Direct**  
2. Basic messaging functionality is demonstrated  
3. UI is implemented using **Jetpack Compose**  
4. Mesh network relaying and persistent storage are in progress
